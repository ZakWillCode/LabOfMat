# LabOfMat
All MatLab code files used during university, with comments and usage notes added, will be updating.

HELL0!

I hope you get as excited as I do when looking at some neat uses of MatLab. Each of these little sample pieces were specifically designed to accomplish some unique tasks. Please feel free to use and play with these code snippets. I have removed any portions that were not written by me. This did cause some breaking but you can easily fill in the blanks.

Enjoy!
